# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game - Odin JavaScript Practice Project ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game project! This practice project is part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com), and it serves as a hands-on practice to solidify my understanding of JavaScript logic and interaction with web development technologies, as well as applying technologies like Git, HTML, and CSS. **Notice:** This and the other projects from the [Odin Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) won't be updated. This is to keep a record of my learning progress and document how my work was when I started in web development.

## Project Description

In this project, I've created a simple web page where users can play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The game allows players to make a selection, and the computer will randomly generate its choice. The winner is then determined based on the rules of the game. This project not only focuses on the JavaScript logic for game functionality but also incorporates HTML and CSS to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface.

## Technologies Used

### Git
Git is used to manage the version control of the project. This allows for easy collaboration, tracking changes, and maintaining a clean project history.

### HTML
HTML provides the basic structure of the web page. It defines the elements and their hierarchy, creating a foundation for the content and functionality.

### CSS
CSS is employed to style and enhance the presentation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It ensures a visually pleasing and responsive layout for an optimal user experience.

### JavaScript
JavaScript forms the core of the project, handling the game logic and user interactions. It enables dynamic content updates and ensures an engaging gaming experience.
